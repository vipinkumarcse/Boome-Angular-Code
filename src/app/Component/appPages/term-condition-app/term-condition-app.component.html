                liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such
                acts or omissions. We may suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any part thereof) if we determine
                that you have violated any provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or content would tend to
                damage our reputation and goodwill. If we delete your account for the foregoing reasons, you may not
                re-register for our Services. We may block your email address and Internet protocol address to prevent

            <p class="fs16 fw_normal text_color_lightgrey mb-3">We do not own any data, information or material
                (collectively, “Content”) that you submit on the Services in the course of using the Service. You shall
                have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, appropriateness,

                obligation to, monitor and review the Content on the Services submitted or created using our Services by
                you. You grant us permission to access, copy, distribute, store, transmit, reformat, display and perform
                the Content of your user account solely as required for the purpose of providing the Services to you.
                Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, we have the right, though not the
                obligation, to, in our own sole discretion, refuse or remove any Content that, in our reasonable
                opinion, violates any of our policies or is in any way harmful or objectionable. You also grant us the
                license to use, reproduce, adapt, modify, publish or distribute the Content created by you or stored in
                your user account for commercial, marketing or any similar purpose.</p>

                payable. Where Services are offered on a free trial basis, payment may be required after the free trial
                period ends, and not when you enter your billing details (which may be required prior to the
                commencement of the free trial period). If auto-renewal is enabled for the Services you have subscribed
                for, you will be charged automatically in accordance with the term you selected. Sensitive and private
                data exchange happens over a SSL secured communication channel and is encrypted and protected with
                digital signatures, and the Services are also in compliance with PCI vulnerability standards in order to
                create as secure of an environment as possible for Users. Scans for malware are performed on a regular
                basis for additional security and protection. If, in our judgment, your purchase constitutes a high-risk
                transaction, we will require you to provide us with a copy of your valid government-issued photo
                identification, and possibly a copy of a recent bank statement for the credit or debit card used for the
                purchase. We reserve the right to change products and product pricing at any time. We also reserve the
                right to refuse any order you place with us. We may, in our sole discretion, limit or cancel quantities
                purchased per person, per household or per order. These restrictions may include orders placed by or
                under the same customer account, the same credit card, and/or orders that use the same billing and/or
                shipping address. In the event that we make a change to or cancel an order, we may attempt to notify you
                by contacting the e-mail and/or billing address/phone number provided at the time the order was made.
